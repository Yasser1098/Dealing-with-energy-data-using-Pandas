# Dealing-with-energy-data-using-Pandas
Transforming and exploring the energy data that is included in three different sources
# The goal

the goal of this project is to transform and clean the data that are present in three different files to answer number of asked questions that help in understanding the energy data that we have

# The Data

As i mentioned the data is present in multiple files so i performed joins between files during the transforming process to get the data in one dataframe to make it easier to deal with, the data also contained many issues in it's validation so i had to deal with that invalidity in order to ensure the integrety of the data that i am dealing with.

# The files include:

the three data source files and a notebook that contains the details of the whole process and asked questions
